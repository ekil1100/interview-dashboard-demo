# Dashboard Demo

You can see the demo on https://inter-demo.ekil.io

Using NextJS, TailwindCSS, and ShadCN UI components.

In addition to the requirements, I added following feature:

- Persistent sign in state using local storage.
- Dialog for create and edit a bot.
- Delete a bot.

Constrictions:

- The agent data is not persistent, it will lose after refresh.
